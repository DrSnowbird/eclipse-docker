* Eclipse-Oxygen + Java 8 JDK + Maven 3.5 + Python 3.5 + X11 (display GUI)

# Components
* Eclipse-Oxygen
* java version "1.8.0_172"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_172-b11)
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.172-b11, mixed mode)
* Apache Maven 3.5.3
* Python 3.5.2
* X11 display desktop
* Other tools: git wget unzip vim python python-setuptools python-dev python-numpy 

# Run (recommended for easy-start)
Image is pulling from openkbs/eclipse-oxygen-docker
```
./run.sh
```

# Build
You can build your own image locally.
```
./build.sh
```

# Configurations (Optional)
If you run "./run.sh" instead of "docker-compose up", you don't have to do anything as below.

* The container uses a default "/workspace" folder. 
* The script "./run.sh" will re-use or create the local folder in your $HOME directory with the path below to map into the docker's internal "/workspace" folder.
```
$HOME/data_docker/eclipse-oxygen-docker/workspace
```
The above configuration will ensure all your projects created in the container's "/workspace" being "persistent" in your local folder, "$HOME/data_docker/eclipse-oxygen-docker/workspace", for your repetitive restart docker container.

# Other possible Issues
You might see the warning message or something similar in the launching xterm console like below, you can just ignore it. I googles around and some blogs just suggested to ignore since the IDE still functional ok.
```
** (eclipse:1): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-wrKH8o5rny: Connection refused

** (java:7): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-wrKH8o5rny: Connection refused
